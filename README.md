# Adticipate

Successful marketing strategies can be expensive and elusive for startups running on limited personnel and budget. Mistargeted ad campaigns often result in failure, wasting time and resources. Adticipate offers startups a marketing workflow and Facebook ad campaign algorithm combined with machine learning that guarantees predictable results with minimal effort.

## The Workflow

Our project provides small businesses with a workflow that they can use in accordance with our dashboard in order to increase the effectiveness and targeting of their Facebook Ads in order to optimize 
* traffic - How people move from an ad to a website or link displayed within it
* engagement - The number of interactions that people provide to a given ad and Facebook page
* conversions - The actual purchases of a product that result from an ad

### Creating a Baseline usine Facebook Ads
Machine learning usually requires "big data" but as we optimized our algorithm for small businesses, we only require approximately 100 rows of data, with each one being an individual ad, in order to be able to make predictions! We use Bayesian Linear Regression which works with data sets of these size. For each ad, several inputs should be varied that you wish to make predictions on. For example, we used
* Target Audience (selected marketing audience on Facebook)
* Content Category (The general theme of the ad)
* Content Type (video, image or event)
* Call to Action (What the ad asks the user to do)
* Amount spent on the ad
